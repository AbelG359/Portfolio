<head>Ending</head>

<p>You find a drill that was thrown into the trash can. You use it to poke a hole and escape!
    (This was going to take too long if I kept going so this is the end, yes this is a lazy ending)
(Also, after you escaped you remembered that you dont like goldfish and got so mad you got stuck in another bowl
and had to repeat the entire process of escaping again)</p>
